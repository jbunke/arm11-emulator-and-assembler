\section{Implementation Strategies}
    I have implemented the execution of the single data transfer instruction. The
    main challenge initially was to figure out how to extract the relevant bits from
    the 32 bit instruction. I decided to use bit masks, which I defined as hexadecimal
    constants in the source file "SingleDataTransfer.c". I will be able to use this
    approach for the assembler (part 2). I will also be able to use the constants
    I defined in the header file I created ("SingleDataTransfer.h"), corresponding
    to my instruction field indexes, as well as the constant bit masks I defined in
    the source file, for each field in the instruction. My header file
    consists of #define constants and function declarations, corresponding to all
    the functions defined in the C source file except the one which executes the
    instruction itself. I believe the functions declared in the header file are useful to
    other group members, especially the person implementing the data processing instruction.
    My source file has a main function which executes the instruction, as well as helper functions
    used by the execute function, which perform specific jobs, for example transferring data or
    computing a memory address. This ensured my execute function wasn't too long.
